# AccuKnox Tasks

This repository contains the three tasks given by AccuKnox for the Trainee Software Engineer role.

## Task 1: API Data Retrieval and Storage
You are tasked with fetching data from an external REST API, storing it in a local SQLite database, and displaying the retrieved data. The API provides a list of books in JSON format with attributes like title, author, and publication year.

#### The solution to this can be found here: [PYTHON FILE](task1_api_data_retrievel_and_storage/main.py)

#### The results and my approach are summarized here: [README.md](task1_api_data_retrievel_and_storage/README.md)

## Task 2: Data Processing and Visualization
Given a dataset containing information about students' test scores, fetch the data from an API, calculate the average score, and create a bar chart to visualize the data.

#### The solution to this can be found here: [Jupyter Notebook](task2_data_processing_and_visualization/main_notebook.ipynb)

#### The results and my approach are summarized here: [README.md](task2_data_processing_and_visualization/README.md)

## Task 3: CSV Data Import to a Database 
Write a Python script that reads data from a CSV file containing user information (e.g., name, email) and inserts it into a SQLite database.

#### The solution to this can be found here: [PYTHON FILE](task3_csv_data_import_to_a_database/main.py)

#### The results and my approach are summarized here: [README.md](task3_csv_data_import_to_a_database/README.md)
